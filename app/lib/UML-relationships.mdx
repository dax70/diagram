In UML, these symbols represent different types of relationships between classes, indicating how they are connected and interact with each other:

<|-- Inheritance (Generalization):
This is the "is-a" relationship, where one class (subclass) inherits all the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass).
\*-- Composition:
Represents a strong "has-a" relationship where a part cannot exist without the whole. If the whole is destroyed, the part is also destroyed.
o-- Aggregation:
A weaker "has-a" relationship where a part can exist independently of the whole.
--> Association:
A general connection between classes, indicating that instances of one class can be related to instances of another class.
..> Dependency:
Shows that one class relies on another class to function, but does not necessarily have a direct "has-a" relationship.
..|> Realization:
Indicates that a class implements the behavior specified by an interface or abstract class.
-- Link (Solid):
A visual representation of the connection between classes in an association relationship.
.. Link (Dashed):
A visual representation of a dependency relationship, typically used for a weaker connection between classes.
